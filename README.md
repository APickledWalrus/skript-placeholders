# skript-placeholders
PlaceholderAPI integration for Skript

This resource is a fork of Ersatz (by Pikachu - https://github.com/Pikachu920/Ersatz) which has been updated to work with PlaceholderAPI's new PlaceholderExpansion system.

There will be more detailed docs on this page coming soon. For now, you can view docs at: https://skripthub.net/docs/ (sort by Ersatz)
