# skript-placeholders
PlaceholderAPI integration for Skript

This plugin is a fork of Ersatz (by Pikachu - https://github.com/Pikachu920/Ersatz) which has been updated to work with PlaceholderAPI's new PlaceholderExpansion system.

There will be more detailed documentation coming soon. For now, you can view documentation at: https://skripthub.net/docs/ (Sort by Ersatz)
